   * EVERY ROW AT AN APP'S CANONICAL URL, LOWEST ID FIRST — THE ANSWERING ROW IS THE HEAD. Several
   * `mcp_servers` rows may point at one `composio://<toolkit>` url (the url has no unique index,
   * deliberately), and the store's `brokeredAppRowsAt` names the row that answers for the app as
   * the first one SQL's `order by id` yields at that url. This is the same rule spelled with the
   * same `order by`, so the deployment's collation decides here exactly as it decides there — a
   * JavaScript sort would be UTF-16 order and could name a different row. It is restated rather
   * than imported because the store's helper is a closure inside `createStore`, and this store is
   * built from the database alone.
   *
   * "AT THE URL" MEANS THE CANONICAL ONE, `composio://${toolkitOf(url)}`, NOT THE DIALLED ROW'S OWN
   * url string. `toolkitOf` (`./composio`) trims whitespace and a trailing slash before it reads
   * the slug, so a row stored as `composio://github/` or `composio://github ` names the toolkit
   * `github` exactly as `composio://github` does — and the store's own gate (`brokeredAppRow`,
   * `accountRefFor`) only ever looks rows up at the trimmed, canonical address. Grouping by the raw
   * stored url instead, as this used to, made such a row an app of its own: an approval granted or
   * read through it could never be found by the gate, which asks at the canonical url and nowhere
   * else. So THIS is "the same rule" the comment above claims — same `order by`, same address the
   * gate itself resolves to.
   *
   * A row whose url is not `composio://` at all, or whose slug `toolkitOf` cannot parse, is an app
   * of its own and is the only row in its answer — the same two cases the store's own gate lets
   * stand rather than refuses (`accountRefFor` reads `toolkitOf` only for a `composio` provenance,
   * and a null result there is read as "not brokered", not as a refusal).
   *
   * NO ROW AT THE CANONICAL URL is answered by falling back to the dialled `serverId` itself, which
   * mirrors what the gate does with the same shape: a row dialled through a non-canonical url with
   * no row at the canonical one is refused by `accountRefFor` before any approval would be
   * consulted, so there is no answering row left to disagree with here either.
   *
   * THE DIALLED ROW'S OWN ID ALWAYS APPEARS IN `ids`, even when its stored url is not the canonical
   * one and so it is not among the siblings selected at that url — so `deleteApprovalsFor` and
   * `botsHolding`, both built on this, also cover the row that was actually dialled.
   *
   * An id with no row answers with itself, so a stale id reads as an app nobody holds and every
   * gate behind it stays shut.
